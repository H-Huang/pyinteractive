# PyInteractive [WIP]

PyInteractive is a static site (no backend) which can run arbitrary Python scripts (with restrictions) in the browser. Ideal for teaching Python or demonstrating scripts and making them visible on the web. Currently a work in progress.

## Usage

1. Clone / fork the repo
2. Add your Python scripts to the `public/py_scripts/` folder
3. Update `src/scriptList.ts` with the name of your script

### Restrictions
